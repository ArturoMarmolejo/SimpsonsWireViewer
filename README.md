============INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP/RUNNING THE PROJECT====

1.- On Android Studio open the left-pane menu "Build Variants"
2.- On the "Active Build Variant" section, choose the corresponding version of the app you would 
like to run (for The Simpsons, select"simpsonsviewerRelease", and for "The Wire" version choose 
"wireviewerrelease"). Click on "Run", and the corresponding App will be installed on the device/emulator
3.- Depending on the screen size, a certain view will be displayed. For tablet devices, a list
of characters with their description and image will be displayed on their corresponding card. For
phone devices, the list will only present the names of the characters. When their card is tapped,
the view will change to another screen where the description and image are present.
4.- Both versions of the app allow to search for any character based on their description or their name.
5.- Both versions of the App are fully compatible with night mode, and have an offline mode as well
that works through a local database, which is automatically updated everytime the user is connected 
to the Internet.
